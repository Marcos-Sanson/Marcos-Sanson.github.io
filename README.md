## About Me

I am a 3rd-year undergraduate computer science student at Grand Valley State University. I am passionate about learning, applying new technologies, and solving complex problems. As a part of my journey, I have completed projects and worked across the United States and internationally, including in Spain. 

In addition to my studies as a computer science student at Grand Valley State University, I also work part-time as a computer science undergraduate researcher. I currently conduct research within the fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to improve evolutionary algorithms.
