## About Me

I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at [Grand Valley State University](https://www.gvsu.edu/), majoring in Computer Science with minors in Mathematics and Cybersecurity. I am passionate about artificial intelligence, evolutionary computation, and solving real-world problems through software systems.

In addition to my coursework, I work as an undergraduate researcher on projects related to machine learning, computational modeling, and biologically-inspired algorithms. 

I have also completed an embedded software engineering internship at [Gentex Corporation](https://www.gentex.com/), where I developed embedded software for automotive systems, integrated new microcontrollers, and collaborated with teams in software testing and project management.

I previously studied abroad at [Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M)](https://www.uc3m.es/), where I participated in research on medical imaging and machine learning.

## Featured Projects

### 1. [Evolvability-Enhancing Mutations via Computational Models](https://github.com/FergusonAJ/quantifying_evolvability)  
**October 2024 ‚Äì May 2025**  
I ran large-scale simulations on NK fitness landscapes to identify mutations that improve long-term evolvability. I analyzed fitness variability, quantified adaptability with statistical metrics, and compared the effects of different mutation patterns. Understanding these mechanisms can advance our knowledge of adaptive systems and help design more robust evolutionary algorithms. 

This research was supported by the [Kindschi Undergraduate Research Fellowship](https://www.gvsu.edu/ours/kindschi-fellowship-860.htm).

### 2. [Automatic Atrium Segmentation with Machine Learning](https://github.com/officialconfuzius/cardiologyml)  
**September 2024 ‚Äì December 2024**  
I developed a machine learning model for 3D atrial segmentation as part of a research team at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. I built data pipelines, preprocessed 3D cardiac imaging, and aligned meshes using neural networks to enhance model accuracy.

### 3. [Phylogeny-Informed Subsampling for Evolutionary Search](https://github.com/amlalejini/phylogeny-informed-subsampling)  
**September 2023 ‚Äì July 2024**  
I improved evolutionary search algorithms using runtime phylogenetic analysis. I designed experiments, analyzed data, and co-authored a peer-reviewed paper presented at [GECCO 2024](https://gecco-2024.sigevo.org/).

### 4. [Procedural 2D Role-Playing Game](https://github.com/Marcos-Sanson/Procedural-RPG)  
**January 2024 ‚Äì April 2024**  
I worked on a procedurally generated 2D RPG as part of a software engineering course. I designed core mechanics, implemented terrain generation, and contributed to gameplay systems and user interface development.

### 5. [Meteorological Software for Environmental Monitoring](https://github.com/Marcos-Sanson/MeteoGalicia-Application)  
**May 2023 ‚Äì November 2023**  
I created a multilingual Python application to automate weather data processing and visualization during my study abroad in Spain. The tool improved processing speed by over 200,000% and supported sustainability projects.

### 6. Integrated Machine Learning for Robot Control  
**October 2022 ‚Äì September 2023**  
I optimized robot gait control by combining machine learning and neuroevolution. I designed experiments, tuned hyperparameters, and analyzed results using PyTorch.

### 7. [Spot Micro Agile Robot Dog](https://sites.google.com/view/senior-tech-project)  
**October 2021 ‚Äì May 2022**  
I built a low-cost quadruped robot modeled after Boston Dynamics‚Äô Spot. I developed Python software for Bluetooth-based control and integrated sensors, 3D-printed components, and embedded systems for locomotion and obstacle detection.
