## About Me

I am a 3rd-year undergraduate computer science student at Grand Valley State University, passionate about learning, applying new technologies, and solving complex problems. My academic and professional journey has taken me across the United States and internationally, including an enriching study abroad experience and internship in Spain.

In addition to my studies, I work part-time as an undergraduate researcher in artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and evolutionary computation (EC) research. My current research involves improving evolutionary algorithms through innovative computational techniques. I am also engaged in building software projects, contributing to open-source initiatives, and continuously exploring new technologies.

## Projects

### 1. **Identifying Evolvability-Enhancing Mutations via Computational Models**  
- **Timeline:** October 2024 ‚Äì Present (expected: April 2025)
- **Description:** Investigating mutations that enhance evolvability using NK landscapes under the mentorship of Dr. Austin Ferguson. Designing computational experiments to analyze fitness data and test evolvability metrics across simulated landscapes. Leveraging high-performance computing to scale simulations and explore long-term evolutionary dynamics.

### 2. **Automatic Atrium Segmentation**  
- **Timeline:** September 2024 ‚Äì Present (expected: December 2024)
- **Description:** Collaborated on a project at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid to develop a machine learning model for 3D atrium segmentation in cardiology. Focused on preprocessing raw 3D medical imaging data, implementing data pipelines, and optimizing mesh alignment using neural networks.

### 3. **Exploiting Phylogenetic Analysis to Improve Evolutionary Search Algorithms**  
- **Timeline:** September 2023 ‚Äì July 2024  
- **Description:** Worked with Dr. Alexander Lalejini on evolutionary search algorithms using phylogenetic analysis to enhance efficiency. Designed and ran experiments on a high-performance computing cluster, creating novel subsampling methods for optimization problems. Co-authored a peer-reviewed paper presented at GECCO 2024.

### 4. **Meteorological Software Application**  
- **Timeline:** May 2023 ‚Äì November 2023  
- **Description:** Developed a Python-based application for automating weather database creation and real-time data visualization at Parque N√°utico de Castrelo. Improved data processing speeds by over 200,000% and supported environmental projects like erosion management. Worked in a cross-cultural team during a study abroad internship program in Spain.

### 5. **Integrating Machine Learning and Evolutionary Algorithms for Robot Control**  
- **Timeline:** October 2022 ‚Äì September 2023  
- **Description:** Collaborated with Dr. Jared Moore to integrate ML and evolutionary algorithms for controlling a quadrupedal robot. Designed experiments, analyzed data, and refined evolutionary algorithms to improve performance in complex tasks.

### 6. **Spot Micro Agile Robot Dog Project**  
- **Timeline:** October 2021 ‚Äì May 2022  
- **Description:** Built a fully-operational agile robot similar to the Boston Dynamics Spot agile mobile robot. Collaborated with a partner to develop software in Python, which allows the robot to be remotely controlled via Bluetooth. Conducted extensive testing and debugging to ensure the robot performed well in various environments. Published project documentation and contributed open-source code.
