      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a 3rd-year undergraduate computer science student at Grand Valley State University. 
        I am passionate about learning, applying new technologies, and solving complex problems. 
        As a part of my journey, I have completed projects and worked across the United States and internationally, 
        including in Spain.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to my studies as a computer science student at Grand Valley State University, I also work part-time 
        as a computer science undergraduate researcher. I currently conduct research within the fields of artificial intelligence (AI) 
        and machine learning (ML) to improve evolutionary algorithms.

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Robot Dog Project and Website</strong><br>
          I built a fully-operational robot similar to the Boston Dynamics Spot agile mobile robot. I collaborated with a partner to develop software in Python, which allows the robot to be remotely controlled via Bluetooth. We conducted extensive testing and debugging to ensure the robot performed well in a variety of environments. The robot utilizes a Raspberry Pi, 3D-printed components, servo motors, ultrasonic sensors, and an LCD display. I also published the project documentation and contributed open-source code. 
          (See website: <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/senior-tech-project">Senior Tech Project Website</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Software Videogames Project - CIS 350: Introduction to Software Engineering</strong><br>
          In this course, I developed a procedurally-generated 2D role-playing game as part of the Software Engineering curriculum. This project involved implementing game mechanics, procedural content generation, and overall game design.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>UC3M Machine Learning Repository</strong><br>
          A repository created during my Machine Learning studies at Carlos III University of Madrid, focusing on algorithms and data analysis methods used in various ML projects. You can access the repository on my <a href="https://github.com/Marcos-Sanson/UC3M-ML">GitHub</a>.
