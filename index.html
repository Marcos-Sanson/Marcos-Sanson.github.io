      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a 3rd-year undergraduate computer science student at Grand Valley State University. 
        I am passionate about learning, applying new technologies, and solving complex problems. 
        As a part of my journey, I have completed projects and worked across the United States and internationally, 
        including in Spain.

        In addition to my studies as a computer science student at Grand Valley State University, I also work part-time as a computer science undergraduate researcher. 
        I currently conduct research within the fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to improve evolutionary algorithms.

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Spot Micro Agile Robot Dog Project</strong><br>
          I built a fully-operational robot similar to the Boston Dynamics Spot agile mobile robot. I collaborated with a partner to develop software in Python, which allows the robot to be remotely controlled via Bluetooth. We conducted extensive testing and debugging to ensure the robot performed well in a variety of environments. The robot utilizes a Raspberry Pi, 3D-printed components, servo motors, ultrasonic sensors, and an LCD display. I also published the project documentation and contributed open-source code. 
          (See website: <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/senior-tech-project">Spot Micro Robot Dog Project Website</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Procedurally-generated 2D Role-playing Game</strong><br>
          I developed a procedurally-generated 2D role-playing game alongside four other students as part of the Software Engineering curriculum at my university. This project involved implementing game mechanics, procedural content generation, and overall game design.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M) Machine Learning Repository</strong><br>
